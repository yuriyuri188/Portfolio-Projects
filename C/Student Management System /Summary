his program implements a Student Management System that uses a stack data structure to manage student records. Each student record contains a name, age, and ID.
The program provides functionalities to create, clone, print, and destroy student records while ensuring input validation.
The stack is designed as a generic data structure with operations like push, pop, peek, print, and capacity management, making it adaptable for other data types as well.
The stack.c and stack.h files define and implement the stack with custom cloning, destroying,
and printing functions provided by the user. The student.c and student.h files implement the specific behavior for managing student records, including memory allocation, validation, and display.
The Makefile automates the build process, compiling the source files into an executable (prog.exe).
