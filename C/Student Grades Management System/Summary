This program implements a Student Grades Management System that maintains a list of students,
where each student has their own list of courses and associated grades. 
It provides functionalities to add students, assign grades for specific courses, 
calculate the average grade of a student, and print individual or all student records.
The program uses a modular approach by leveraging a linked list data structure (linked-list.h) 
to dynamically manage students and their respective courses.
It includes efficient cloning, memory management, and searching mechanisms to handle the addition and retrieval of student data.
