This C program implements three functions (`m_sum`, `m_min`, and `m_max`) to calculate the sum,
minimum, and maximum of a variable number of positive integer arguments using variadic functions.
It also contains test cases that randomly generate 3, 5, and 10 integers, test the correctness of these functions by comparing their results with manually calculated expectations,
and validate the output. The program runs for a specified number of test cases and prints "Correct Answer" if all checks pass or "Wrong Answer" otherwise.
