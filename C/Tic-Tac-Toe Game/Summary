This program implements a variant of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game called Avoidance Tic-Tac-Toe.
The game allows two players, represented as P1 and P2, to take turns making moves on a dynamic board of size specified by the user (up to 11x11).
The game introduces additional mechanics such as move erasure, where players can "undo" a specified number of past turns to modify the board. 
It keeps track of moves using a turn history table, ensuring the correct order of moves can be erased.
The program includes logic to check for winning conditions, such as filling rows, columns, diagonals, or handling edge cases like a board size of 1.
