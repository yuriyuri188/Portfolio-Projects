This program finds the smallest number that, when raised to its own power, divides a given number. 
It performs prime factorization of the input, identifies the primes and their powers, and calculates the smallest number sharing the same primes. 
If the input is a prime number, it simply outputs the number.
Otherwise, it adjusts the smallest number to meet the condition by iteratively multiplying it with the smallest prime factor. The result is then printed as the output.
